Guidelines: In this repository, you will find one of 6 notebook related to this project. This notebook deals 
with the paris dataset analysis and is structurally similar to the other 6 notebook.
You will find : 
--> A folder containing, some generated images from previous simulation 
--> The actual python notebook 
--> Paris Network dataset

In this project our objective was to propose methods and techniques that address inefficiency encountered
in global transportation network design. Indeed, we carried out studies of relevant measures of network
distances and implement them in Python to analyze how they perform on various transportation network
datasets. For instance we have shown that the resistance metric can be used to capture both well-
connected hubs and help identify areas in a network that may benefit from increased connectivity or
efficiency improvements. We have introduced a new tunable hybrid metric that urban planner or airline
operations planners could use to quantify their network distances not only in terms of the traveling
cost but also in terms of CO2 emissions and communicability distance. Our study have demonstrated
that by tuning these parameters, it is possible to get various different profiles in the distances between
destinations in a network.Amongst other.
