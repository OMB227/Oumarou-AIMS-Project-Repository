## Theoretical Background

### Problem Definition
Transportation networks often lack optimal efficiency, leading to increased travel costs, congestion, and environmental impacts like COâ‚‚ emissions. The goal of this study is to explore network distance metrics and develop strategies to optimize these networks, making them more cost-effective and sustainable.

### Communicability Metric (Detailed proof can be found in the related report)
The **communicability function** measures how effectively information or movement propagates between nodes in a network. It is computed using the spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix `A`:
   
   ```math
   C_{pq} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \phi_j(p) \phi_j(q) e^{\lambda_j}
   ```
   
where $Ï•_j(p), Ï•_j(q)$ are the p-th and q-th elements of the j-th orthonormal eigenvector of `A`, associated with the eigenvalue $Î»_j$. This metric captures both direct and indirect connections, offering insights into network efficiency.

The communicability **distance metric** is then defined as:
   
   ```math
   \xi_{pq} = C_{pp} + C_{qq} - 2C_{pq}
   ```
   
where $C_{pp}$ and $C_{qq}$ measure self-communicability, while $C_{pq}$ measures the interaction between nodes `p` and `q`. 

**Proof that Communicability Distance is Euclidean:** 

Using the spectral decomposition of `A`, we rewrite $C_{pq}$ as:
   
   ```math
   C_{pq} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \phi_j(p) \phi_j(q) e^{\lambda_j}
   ```
   
Thus, the communicability distance satisfies:
   
   ```math
   \xi_{pq} = ||x_p - x_q||^2
   ```
   
where $x_p = e^{\Delta/2} \phi_p$, proving that the communicability distance is Euclidean.

### Hybrid Distance Measure (Detailed proof can be found in the related report)
To address inefficiencies in transportation networks, we introduce a **hybrid metric** that incorporates:
- **Traditional shortest-path distance ($d_{pq}$)**
- **COâ‚‚ emissions per trip ( $d_{CO_2}(p, q)$ )**
- **Communicability distance ($C_{pq}$)**

The hybrid distance is defined as:
   
   ```math
   H_{pq} = \alpha d_{pq} + \beta d_{CO_2}(p, q) + \gamma C_{pq}
   ```
   
where `Î±, Î², Î³` are tunable parameters that allow for balancing the contributions of cost, environmental impact, and network efficiency.

**Proof that $H_{pq}$ is a Valid Distance Metric:**
1. **Non-negativity:**
   
   ```math
   H_{pq} \geq 0, \quad \text{since} \quad d_{pq} \geq 0, \quad d_{CO_2}(p, q) \geq 0, \quad C_{pq} \geq 0.
   ```
   
2. **Symmetry:**
   
   ```math
   H_{pq} = H_{qp}, \quad \text{since all terms are symmetric.}
   ```
   
3. **Triangle Inequality:**
   
   ```math
   H_{pq} \leq H_{pw} + H_{wq}, \quad \forall p, q, w \in V.
   ```
   
Thus, $H_{pq}$ satisfies the conditions of a metric.

### Rewiring Algorithms
To improve transportation network efficiency, a **rewiring strategy** was developed. The goal is to adjust the network structure by:
- Modifying connections to balance communicability and shortest paths.
- Ensuring connectivity while optimizing travel efficiency.

The rewiring process follows:
   
   1. Compute communicability and shortest-path distributions.
   2. Identify regions with inefficient connectivity.
   3. Adjust edges to improve balance while maintaining network integrity.

## Project Objectives & Key Findings
Our primary objective is to explore and develop techniques that improve the efficiency of transportation networks. Key findings from our analysis include:

- **Network Distance Metrics**: We analyzed various distance measures to assess their effectiveness in identifying well-connected hubs and areas that require improved connectivity.
- **Resistance Metric**: Demonstrated effectiveness in detecting both well-connected hubs and regions needing better integration.
- **Hybrid Metric**: Showed that adjusting the balance between travel cost, environmental impact, and network efficiency can yield optimized transportation routes.
- **Rewiring Strategy**: Successfully modified network structures to enhance connectivity while reducing inefficiencies.
